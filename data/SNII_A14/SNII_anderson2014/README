This directory contains all V-band photometry used in the analysis of
Anderson et al. (2014), A14. In a future publication, local sequence photometry,
together with details of each telescope/instrument used to obtain the photometry of
each individual supernova will be presented.

Here, we also include a file (upperlimits.dat) which contains published
upper limits for the non-detection of the supernovae used in A14.

Finally, this directory also contains a file (Measurements_A14.dat), which
has all measured/defined parameters used to obtain the results of A14, some of
which were not published in the actual paper, together with a separate file
explaining its contents (measurements_caption.dat).

If there are any doubts about any of the above, please contact the first author
of A14, Joe Anderson at: janderso@eso.org.

Enjoy!
